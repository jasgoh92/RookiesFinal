                <h1> The Pandemic forced us to adapt </h1>
                <p class ="content-text">The pandemic changed the world in many ways and even our humble Nasi Lemak stall had to change. The circuit breaker showed us that we had to adapt if not we would slowly be forced out of business. We incorporated minimal technology in running our stall and we realised that we had to take a risk if not we might not be able to operate in this new environment. Hence, we invested our time and money and came up with a website to help streamline our processes.  </p>

Alongside this initiative, our stall has even offered to increase the usual portions in our vegetable dishes up by 50%. You can even request for a "kurang lemak" rice which is a healthier version of our usual rice. It is cooked with EVAPORATED MILK instead!  </p>
